Vivic, sponsored by 613-819 Black Hub, undertook community consultations to explore the possibility of a non-police response to mental health crises. The report reviews public policies that have contributed to crises situations, the history and current operations of emergency responses, existing alternatives across North America and available responses in Ottawa. The strategy is a detailed proposal of a non-police mental health crisis response that would better meet community needs, and includes the cost of the program and concrete steps to reallocate funding from the Ottawa Police Service.
