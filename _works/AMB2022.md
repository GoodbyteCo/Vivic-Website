For the second consecutive year, the Ottawa Coalition for a People’s Budget and Vivic Research present a progressive alternative budget for the City of Ottawa. Building off and learning from last year’s experience, this budget puts forwards policies that would improve the lives of all community members, rather than allow developer influence to run the city.
