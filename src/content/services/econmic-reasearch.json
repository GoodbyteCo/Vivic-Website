"description": "Economic theory currently plays a major role in political decision making and can be a powerful tool to expose inequalities and to assess if a policy is meeting its stated objectives. Examples of services we offer include comparative studies, time-series analysis, salary anomaly studies, and needs assessments. We incorporate quantitative findings from our focus groups, surveys, and interviews to data-driven projects to ensure that our findings are data-driven and are anchored in lived expertise."
