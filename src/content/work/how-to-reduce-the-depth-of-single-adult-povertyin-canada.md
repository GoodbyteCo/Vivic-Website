Vivic was engaged by the Maytree Foundation and Community Food Centres Canada to develop a microsimulation model of a new federal tax credit targeted to low-income, working-age singles. Using data from the SPSD/M and the programming language R, the team built the model and produced several metrics of program efficiency and effectiveness, including some custom metrics. As part of the project, the Vivic team also undertook a scan of other jurisdictions which was used to benchmark the proposed program against those of other nations.
