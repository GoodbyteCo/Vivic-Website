Vivic Research was retained to estimate the potential employment impacts of the proposed investments in Spending What it Takes: Transformational climate investments for long-term prosperity in Canada published by Climate Action Network Canada and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. In this report, the potential employment effects of the proposed investments are estimated using an input-output (I-O) model of the Canadian economy. Our results suggest that the proposed investments could result in an average of an additional 145,900 â€“ 176,000 jobs over the next five years, with employment increasing over time along with the proposed investments.
