The Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development Canada commissioned
this study of Competition Issues in Data-Driven Markets in Canada in the fall of 2021. 
This independent expert report takes a case study approach, exploring nine business
behaviours that occur in a digital context and testing how they may or may not be
currently contemplated under the Competition Act. It concludes with a cross-cutting
policy approach that will aid in preserving and encouraging competition in data-driven
markets. The opinions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily
reflect those of the Government of Canada.
