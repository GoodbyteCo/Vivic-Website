Vivic, sponsored by 613-819 Black Hub, undertook community consultations to explore
the possibility of a non-police response to mental health crises. The report reviews
public policies that have contributed to crises situations, the history and current
operations of emergency responses, existing alternatives across North America and
available responses in Ottawa. The strategy is a detailed proposal of a non-police
mental health crisis response that would better meet community needs, and includes
the cost of the program and concrete steps to reallocate funding from the Ottawa
Police Service.
