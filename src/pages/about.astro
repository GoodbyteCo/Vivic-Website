      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in 2020 by Inez Hillel and Robin Shaban, Vivic Research supports
        actors working toward systems change through economic and evidence-based
        research. Our previous academic and work experience in economics and
        growing frustration with the status quo left us seeking a space where we
        could combine our expertise in economics with our passion for
        community-focused work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January 2023, Robin left the Vivic team to pursue other projects.
        Although it was tough to say goodbye to one of our co-founders, we
        remain committed to our vision of a just society, where everyone has
        access to research, information, and data to participate in the
        decision-making processes that impact their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that when combined with public education and advocacy,
        research can be a tool for social change. To make our vision a reality,
        Vivic Research strives to collaborate with actors working towards
        systems change and confronting oppressive structures by providing
        alternatives to traditional economic and public policy research.

      <p>
        Inez Hillel is co-founder and economist of Vivic Research. Inez is
        devoted to intersectional economics, which emphasizes frontline voices

        management, and relationship building with new and long-term clients.
        She is most passionate about projects that require ongoing community

      <h3>Farnaz <span class="pronouns">(she/her)</span></h3>
      <h4>Researcher</h4>
      <p>
        Farnaz is a researcher at Vivic Research. In her work, Farnaz
        takes a critical research approach that focuses on identifying the
        underlying structures that perpetuate social injustice and harm.
        Farnaz's responsibilities at Vivic include conducting qualitative
        research and analysis, developing research proposals, writing
        comprehensive reports, and collaborating with clients to ensure their
        needs are met. Previously, Farnaz worked as a project manager and
        research coordinator for community-based research initiatives. Her
        research has focused on marginalized youth’s perspectives on mental
        health and substance use. She believes that research is most effective
        when the communities impacted by its outcomes are able to guide and
        participate in the process. Farnaz holds a graduate degree in Criminology. Her
        dedication to social justice and community-based research is reflected
        in her work at Vivic Research.

      <h3>Jay <span class="pronouns">(they/them)</span></h3>
      <h4>Researcher</h4>
      <p>
        Jay is a researcher at Vivic Research. Their work highlights and challenges discourses and rhetoric that perpetuate stigma, harm, and inaction by institutions and government by situating policy narratives within a sociopolitical context.
        Jay's responsibilities at Vivic include qualitative and quantitative research and analysis, report writing, and knowledge translation including social media content and public presentations. They believe that people are better equipped to act and organize on the issues that affect their lives when they have access to accessible and relevant research and data. Jay holds two graduate degrees in Education and Health Sciences and their previous work has included critical analysis of discourse on trans and gender non-conforming youth in sport and research projects advocating for COVID safety for workers.
