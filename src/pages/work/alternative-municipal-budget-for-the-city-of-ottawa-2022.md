Vivic Research collaborated with the Ottawa Coalition for a People’s Budget for a second consecutive year to create a progressive alternative budget for the City of Ottawa. Building on and learning from the previous year’s experience, this budget puts forward policies that would improve the lives of all community members, rather than continue to allow developer influence to run the city. An exercise in participatory budget-making, part of this project included holding community conversations on topics related to housing, climate, transit, and policing.
