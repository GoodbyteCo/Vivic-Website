For the second consecutive year, the Ottawa Coalition for a People’s Budget and Vivic
Research present a progressive alternative budget for the City of Ottawa. Building
off and learning from last year’s experience, this budget puts forwards policies that
would improve the lives of all community members, rather than allow developer influence
to run the city.
