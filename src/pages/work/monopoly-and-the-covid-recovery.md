Vivic Research presented at the 2021 Canadian Economics Association conference on how to create a more just and resilient economy post-pandemic. The presentation highlighted how monopolies create the conditions for market power, which in turn enables businesses to extract income and wealth from others further down the wealth distribution. Due in part to weak competition laws, underenforcement of the law in labour markets, and limited access to data, the Competition Bureau does not have the tools to promote a just economy.
