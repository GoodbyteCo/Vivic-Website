In work done for the Ottawa Coalition for a Peopleâ€™s Budget, Vivic Research created the
Alternative Budget which presents a progressive and ambitious vision for the City of Ottawa and
its
finances. The proposals put forward in this alternative budget require substantial funding. To
fund
them, we have reallocated millions of dollars from the police budget to other City programs,
reduced
spending on fossil fuel infrastructure, and implemented new taxes.
