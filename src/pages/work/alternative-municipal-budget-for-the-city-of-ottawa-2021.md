Vivic Research and the Ottawa Coalition for a People’s Budget collaborated to cost out a progressive and ambitious vision for the City of Ottawa and its finances. The Alternative Budget explores how the city could meaningfully invest in social infrastructure, housing, transit, and climate by divesting from policing and fossil fuels. This fully balanced budget includes $662.8M in additional spending on programs and services and $215.5M on infrastructure. The collaborative nature of the project is intended to capture the diverse needs of Ottawa residents while raising public awareness about the biases that the City’s actual budget reinforces.
