Vivic Research supported Children First Canada’s research team to estimate the economic costs of the tripledemic paediatric crisis. Using Statistics Canada’s Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs) for the Labour Force Survey from 2016-2022, a time-series decomposition with locally weighted regression determined mothers of children under 12 incurred the largest productivity loss due to caregiving, resulting in an economic loss of nearly $50 million for the Canadian economy. The findings showed immigrant, working-class, and single mothers faced additional challenges that made it difficult for them to take time off during the peak of the crisis.
