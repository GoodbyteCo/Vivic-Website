Vivic Research presented at The Western Law Economics Research Group and ASCOLA Canada's panel Labour Markets and the Competition Act on the intersection of competition and labour policy and the relevance of monopsony power for workers. The most direct intervention for poverty and social exclusion is to develop inclusive economies and markets. To improve intervention efficacy and equity, Vivic suggests that competition policy in labour markets be considered as an alternative approach to transfer programs.
