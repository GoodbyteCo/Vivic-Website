Vivic Research co-authored Campaign 2000â€™s annual report card on the status of child poverty in Canada. The report examined child poverty through a human rights lens and applied a social determinants of health framework to the analysis. Income data from the T1 Family File demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated poverty, which will continue to have an impact on children and families in the coming years. Over 60 recommendations were put forward across all levels of government, reaffirming the importance of community input and incorporating trauma-informed principles into policymaking.
