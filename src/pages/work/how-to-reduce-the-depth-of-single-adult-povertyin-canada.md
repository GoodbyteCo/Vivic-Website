In partnership with the Maytree Foundation and Community Food Centres Canada, Vivic Research developed a microsimulation model of a new federal tax credit targeted to low-income, working-age single adults. Programmed in R and using SPSD/M data, several custom and industry-standard metrics were implemented to evaluate program efficiency and effectiveness. In total, Vivic modelled eleven scenarios to understand their cost and impact. The Vivic team also undertook an international jurisdictional scan of programs that target working-age single adults to inform a literature review of existing and proposed models.
