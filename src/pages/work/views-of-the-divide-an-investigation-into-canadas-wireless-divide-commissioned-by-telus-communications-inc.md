Vivic Research was commissioned by TELUS to investigate Canada’s wireless divide. Vivic found that approximately 4.3 million people in Canada fall into the wireless divide, having either no mobile device or cellular data plan. To better understand the wireless divide in Canada, this report combines quantitative data from Statistics Canada’s 2020 Canadian Internet Use Survey (CIUS) with qualitative interviews with organizations working with individuals experiencing the wireless divide in Canada, using a framework of access, affordability, and digital skills.
