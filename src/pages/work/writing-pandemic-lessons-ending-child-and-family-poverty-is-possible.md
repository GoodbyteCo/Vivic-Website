Vivic Research co-authored Campaign2000â€™s annual report card on the status of child poverty in Canada for the second consecutive year. Data analysis revealed that the 40% reduction in child poverty from the previous year was due in large part to temporary pandemic transfers from the federal government to families and individuals. This showed the extent to which governments can end poverty through policy choices that impact children and families' access to income security, housing, decent work, childcare, and healthcare.
