Vivic Research, in collaboration with the Centre for Resilience and Social Development and the Ottawa Coalition for Community Houses, examines the underlying causes of community-level street-based violence, including gun violence. This study explores strategies for preventing youth violence by addressing the social conditions that sustain violence at interpersonal, community, and state levels. Through a comprehensive literature review, the report highlights the impact of social issues such as racism, poverty, and criminalization, while emphasizing how carceral interventions and state violence create and exacerbate these challenges. The report concludes by calling for approaches to these forms of violence that are grounded in Transformative Justice with a specific focus on the context and needs of the individuals involved.
