Vivic Research worked with Simon Enoch from the Saskatchewan Office of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) to unpack seven common myths about privatization in the CCPAâ€™s The Monitor. The article critiques the idea that privatization will lead to cost savings, generate more jobs, improve service quality, reduce debt, and introduce competition and efficiency. Evidence from previous privatization schemes, data from the Labour Force Survey, and Modern Monetary Theory are used to explain how privatization is likely to produce counterproductive outcomes contrary to commonly held beliefs.
