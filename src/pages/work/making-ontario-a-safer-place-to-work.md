Vivic Research worked with the Ontario Compensation Employees Union (OCEU) to investigate trends in funding for Ontario's Health and Safety Associations (HSAs). Vivic analyzed shifts in the total funding and funding mix of the HSAs from 2013 to 2020 and examined how claim rates, injury rates, and fatalities changed over the last decade. These shifts in lost-time injury rates and fatalities have occurred against a backdrop of decreased core funding to HSAs. To improve workplace safety, Vivic recommends that provincial governments restore funding for prevention initiatives that were cut by previous governments.
