Vivic Research summarized findings from 13 studies developed by Employment and Social Development Canada on the state of the Canadian Employment Insurance (EI) Program. The studies explore different aspects of the EI program, such as apprenticeships, training, the compassionate care benefit, the work-sharing program, eligibility barriers, and the program's impact on poverty and income redistribution. Building on the program’s demonstrated ability for income redistribution, we proposed recommendations to bolster the program’s potential to prevent poverty.
