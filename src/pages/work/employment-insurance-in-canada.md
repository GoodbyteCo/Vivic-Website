The Vivic team summarizes relevant findings from 13 studies developed by Employment
and Social Development Canada on the state of the Employment Insurance Program 2013
and 2019. The studies examine many facets of the EI program, such as apprenticeships,
training, the compassionate care benefit, the work-sharing program, the reasons why
those who are eligible for benefits do not apply, and the extent to which the program
alleviates poverty and redistributes income across program participants.
