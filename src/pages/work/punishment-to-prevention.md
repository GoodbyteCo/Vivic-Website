Vivic Research conducted focus groups and surveys in collaboration with the Centre for Resilience and Social Development (CRSD) and the Ottawa Coalition of Community Houses (OCCH). These efforts aim to recontextualize the conversation surrounding gun violence and youth street-level violence, with the central objective of untangling policing narratives from community voices. Through these consultations, Vivic Research sought to centre perspectives from youth, adults, and service providers concerning the underlying causes of youth violence and potential non-carceral, community-based solutions to address it. Some key findings include the perception of police as an additional danger by youth, the importance of non-carceral approaches like employment opportunities and reduced police presence, and the need for community-based solutions and independent data analysis to address youth violence effectively.
