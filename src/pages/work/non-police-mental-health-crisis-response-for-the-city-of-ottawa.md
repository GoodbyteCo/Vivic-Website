Vivic Research collaborated with 613-819 Black Hub to produce a comprehensive report that would explore the feasibility and cost of a non-police response model to mental health crises in Ottawa. The final report is a combination of extensive community consultations and a thorough review of other crisis response models in jurisdictions across North America. We explored why co-response models fall short of meeting the needs of people in crisis, and unpacked the social determinants of mental health to incorporate a heavy focus on preventing crisis through adequately supporting all residents and transforming systems that cause harm.
