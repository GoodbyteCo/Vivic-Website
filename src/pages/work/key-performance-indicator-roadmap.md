Vivic Research worked to develop six key performance indicators (KPIs) to track the success of the Fort Calgary Society in advancing their reconciliation and cultural heritage goals, based on a logic model and visitor survey. The KPIs developed were heritage, reconciliation, tourism impact, seniors, interaction, and affordability. The use of KPIs facilitated a clear correlation between activities and outcomes, enhancing stakeholders' understanding of the value the Fort brought to the community. Furthermore, these KPIs empowered the Fort to make data-informed decisions, maximizing its impact.
