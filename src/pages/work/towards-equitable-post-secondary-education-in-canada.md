Vivic Research worked with the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) to review trends in Canadian higher education tuition from the 1970s onwards, with comparisons to education funding policies from other jurisdictions. The research highlighted how approaching higher education policies in isolation from their wider societal context can reinforce larger systemic barriers in education. To support CFS’s advocacy for progressive change in Canada’s approach to funding education, we explored how policy recommendations aimed at easing the burden of student debt and tuition prices could prioritize the needs of low-income and otherwise marginalized students.
