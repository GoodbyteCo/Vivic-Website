Vivic Research and Courage Ottawa put forward 15 recommendations for how safety on transit can be improved in Ottawa without relying on punishment and exclusion. This report explores a variety of approaches that can enhance safety on transit, including eliminating fares, repealing loitering by-laws, substituting Special Constables with Transit Ambassadors, improving the efficiency and reliability of the service, retrofitting stations, and changing social norms. These recommendations were co-developed with transit riders in focus groups while being anchored in evidence-based best practices.
