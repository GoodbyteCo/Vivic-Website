Vivic Research used Oxfam’s Care Policy Scorecard Tool to evaluate the federal government’s care policies across health and child care, employment protections, immigration policy, and infrastructure investments. Based on literature review and focus groups facilitated by Oxfam Canada, the research revealed advances in recent federal investments in child care, long-term care, and public transportation and also highlighted several areas of concern around access to clean water for First Nations, and worker protections in the care economy. Recommendation from the report focused on investments in healthcare and education, gender equity in labour protections, and public education campaigns around gender norms in care work.
