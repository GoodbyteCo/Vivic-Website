                    We develop boutique research studies focusing on targeted issues related to the intersection of
                    policy, economics, and social justice. This includes but is not limited to literature reviews,
                    policy recommendations, community consultation and cost/benefit analysis. Our past work has included
                    costing an alternative municipal budget for the city of Ottawa with an emphasis on racial and gender
                    equity, research on Employment Insurance and best practices for post-secondary education fees and
                    debt cancellation.
