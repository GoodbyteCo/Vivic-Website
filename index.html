                    We develop boutique research studies focusing on targeted issues related to the intersection of

                    policy recommendations, community consultation and cost/benefit analysis. Our past work has included
                    costing an alternative municipal budget for the city of Ottawa with an emphasis on racial and gender
                    equity, research on Employment Insurance and best practices for post-secondary education fees and
                    debt cancellation.

                        This Alternative Budget presents a progressive and ambitious vision for the City of Ottawa and
                        its
                        finances. The proposals put forward in this alternative budget require substantial funding. To
                        fund
                        them, we have reallocated millions of dollars from the police budget to other City programs,
                        reduced
                        spending on fossil fuel infrastructure, and implemented new taxes. <a class="read-more"
